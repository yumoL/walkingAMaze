### Performance Testing

In the performance testing I'm going to test the efficiency of BFS-algorithm and A*-algorithm. A*-algorithm is implmented by using different heuristic functions including Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance. Algorithms' execution time and traversed nodes will be measured. I'm going to test the efficiency of the algorithms mentioned before in different sizes of graphs. Also a graph with the same size will be generated in different ways, using DFS- and randomized-Prim-algorithms. Graphs gnerated by DFS have a low branching factor and their paths are usually long corridors. Graphs generated by randomized Prim have relatively higher branching factor and their paths are shorter than the paths in graphs generated by DFS.
