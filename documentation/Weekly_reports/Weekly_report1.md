# Week1 Report

Used hours: 6h

I decided what kind of project I'm going to do in this course, which are a maze solver and maze generator. I read about different
algorithms to generate a maze and also algorihtms to walk a maze. I also read some tutorials about Java Swing, which I will use to visualize a maze. 
Concepts such as double buffering and anti-aliasing which are used to improve the visualization are totally new to me. 

For now the program is able to read a maze from a txt.-file and print it to the console. Since I'm not familiar with any visualization tool which can be used in Java, the most things I've learned this week is about the use of Java Swing, such as the use of JFrame and JPanel, and also how to listen to a key and a 
mouse event. Next week I'm going to use the new things I've leaned this week to visualize a maze and then concentrate on the implementation of the algorithms. Next week the program is supposed to visualize a maze using Java Swing. The program
should also be able to walk through a maze using at least DFS.

### Here's a question

- Since I use different algorithms to walk through a maze, will it be enough that user can walk through a maze using different algorithms? For example when user chooses "using DFS" then the program walks through a maze using DFS and when user chooses "Using A*" then the program walks through a maze using A*-search. Or should I also make a table to compare the efficiency of different algorithms? For example when user chooses "walking the maze", then there is a table which shows something like walking the maze using BFS spent x seconds and walking the maze using A*-search spent y seconds.
