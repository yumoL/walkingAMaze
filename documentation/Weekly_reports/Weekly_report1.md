# Week1 Report

Used hours: 6h

I decided what kind of project I'm going to do in this course, which are a maze solver and maze generator. I read about different
algorithms to generate a maze and also algorihtms to walk a maze. I also read some tutorials about Java Swing, which I will use to visualize a maze. 
Concepts such as double buffering and anti-aliasing which are used to improve the visualization are totally new to me. 

For now the program is able to read a maze from a txt.-file and print it to the console. Since I'm not familiar with any visualization tool which can be used in Java, the most things I've learned this week is about the use of Java Swing, such as the use of JFrame and JPanel, and also how to listen a key and a 
mouse event. Next week I'm going to use the new things I've leanr this week to visualize a maze and then concentrate on the implementation of the algorithms. Next week the program is supposed to visualize a maze using Java Swing. The program
should also be able to walk through a maze using at least DFS.

### Here's a question

- Since I use different algorithms to walk a maze, will it be enough that I just walk through a maze using different algorithms
