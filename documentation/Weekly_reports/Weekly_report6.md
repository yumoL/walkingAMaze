# Week6 Report
Used hours: 10h

### What I did
- I created a seperate class which is used to do the performance tests to avoid wasting time to wait for the rendering of the graphs.
- I did performance tests and completed the testing- and implementation document.

### What I learnt
- I had a deeper understanding about how a heuristic function can affect the efficiency of A* when the results of the performance tests are shown as charts.

### What I'm going to do
- I'll continue refactoring my codes. 
- I'll start to write the user guide.
