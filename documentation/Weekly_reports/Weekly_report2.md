# Week2 Report

Used hours: 16h

This week I added the configuration of Jacoco, Travis and Codcov. Using Travis I can see whether the building of my project succeeded or not and also avoid the problem of "but it works on my computer". Using Codcov the test coverage of my codes can be updated automatically and other people can see them directly in the front page of my project.

I spent most of my time this week in writing algorothms of path finding in a maze. For now the program is able to find a route from entrance point to exit point using DFS(with recursion and without recursion) and BFS. In addition, the program is also able to show the process of path finding and the final route to users. The DFS- and BFS-algorithms aren't so hard themselves, but visualising them using Java Swing cost me quite much time. 

The most interesting thing I learnt this week was the visualisation of the algorithms. I also got deeper understanding of the connection between recursion and iteration (how recursion can be implemented using stack). I also realised the connection between DFS without recusrion and BFS, the logics of them are almost same, the only difference between them is they use different data structures. 

The most difficult problem I faced this week was the implemention of A*-algorithm. I understood the basic idea of A*-algorithm, but when trying to implement it, I had many problems in details, not to mention visualising it. 

Next week I wish I can work out the A*-algorithm. I'm going to start to implement my own data structures (stack, queue and maybe ArrayList) and to refactor my codes since there are a lot of repeated codes in the class of algorithms. If there' still time remaining, I will start to generate my own maze.
