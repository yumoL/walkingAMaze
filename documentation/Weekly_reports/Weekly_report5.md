# Week5 Report

Used hours 15h

### What I did
- This week I spent less time on the project than the previous weeks. I implemented my own HashMap using chaining method. 
- I started performance testing and continued writing the implementation- and testing documents.
- I added some test cases in unit tests to make sure data structures still work properly when inputs are unavailable. 
- I wrote the console UI where user can input the size of his graph and decide which way his graph will be generated. 

### What I learnt
- I had deeper undestanding about how HashMap works in Java internally, especially how chaining method works.
- I wrote a code review about another student's project where he is implementing Fibonacci heap, I realized maybe Fibonacci heap can also be used in the A*-algorithm to improve its efficiency.

### What I'm going to do
- I'll continue the performance testing and analyse the results of performance testing
- I'll finish the implementation- and testing document and start to write the user guide.
